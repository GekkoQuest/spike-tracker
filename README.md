## üö© Installation & Setup

Clone the repository and enter the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GekkoQuest/spike-tracker.git
cd spike-tracker
```

Set your Discord bot token as an environment variable:

**Linux/MacOS**:
```bash
export DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
```

Windows (cmd):
```bash
set DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
```

Windows PowerShell:
```bash
$env:DISCORD_TOKEN="YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
```

Run the application locally:
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` to view running matches.

---

## ü§ñ Discord Usage

To receive Discord updates, you'll need to define a channel by using the following command:
```bash
#setchannel
```

Once the command is set, the bot will continuously provide live match updates.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

The current implementation prioritizes Discord integration. If your Discord channel isn't set, then the website will not showcase Valorant matches. Future releases may improve the website to run independently.

---

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build --build-arg DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN -t spike-tracker .
```

Run the Docker container:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN spike-tracker
```

Visit the deployed app:
```
http://localhost:8080
```
